      <h2 class="about-title">A Maker's Quiet Rebellion</h2>

      <p>Docotela X began as a resistance to speed and conformity. Every fold, seam and finish is an argument for time — slow, deliberate, human. We craft collections as fragments of a life, each collection a chamber of memory and motion.</p>

      <p>We failed many times. We rebuilt a 1978 Beetle by hand across six years to prove a point — consistency matters. That project became proof that vision and patience can make the impossible look inevitable. That ethos is sewn into every piece.</p>

      <p class="highlight">Limited runs. Handcrafted details. Quiet confidence.</p>

      <p>We believe true luxury is freedom — the freedom to choose who we are and how we move. Docotela X is an invitation to that feeling.</p>
